      "raw_text": "SHANTI Bill 2025: Opening India’s Nuclear Sector\nPrelims:\n(Polity & Governance + CA)\nMains:\n(GS 2: International Relations, Government Policies\n;\nGS Paper – 3: Nuclear Energy, Infrastructure)\nWhy in News ?\nParliament has passed the\nSustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025\n, fundamentally restructuring India’s nuclear power framework by\nallowing private participation\nin nuclear power plant operations and related activities.\nBackground and Context\nIndia’s nuclear power sector has historically been\nstate-dominated\n, governed by the\nAtomic Energy Act, 1962\n, with operational control vested in public sector entities. While nuclear energy is crucial for\nclean baseload power\n, capacity expansion has remained slow due to capital intensity, liability concerns, and limited public resources.\nWith India targeting\n100 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047\n—to meet climate commitments and energy security needs—the government argues that\nprivate investment and technology partnerships\nare essential. The SHANTI Bill seeks to modernise the legal framework to align nuclear power with India’s broader infrastructure and clean energy ambitions.\nPrivate Sector Entry under SHANTI Bill, 2025\nExpanded Participation\nAllows\npublic and private companies\nto set up and operate nuclear power plants\nPermits private involvement in:\nTransport and storage of nuclear fuel\nImport/export of nuclear equipment and technology\nHandling of specified nuclear materials (non-sensitive segments)\nStrict Safety and Regulatory Oversight\nMandatory authorisation from the\nAtomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB)\nRegulatory approval required for:\nManufacture, possession, transport, and disposal of radioactive materials\nEstablishment, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear and radiation facilities\nForeign Investment: Conditional Access\nNo explicit allowance for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)\nParticipation possible only through\nCentral Government notification\nExpected alignment with\nDPIIT foreign equity norms\n, subject to security considerations\nActivities Reserved for the State\nCertain sensitive functions remain\nexclusively under Central Government control\n, including:\nUranium enrichment and isotopic separation\nReprocessing of spent fuel and management of high-level nuclear waste\nProduction and upgradation of heavy water\nAccountability and Liability Framework\nDilution of Supplier Liability\nRemoves the automatic\n“right of recourse”\nagainst equipment suppliers present under the CLNDA, 2010\nOperators can claim damages from suppliers only if:\nExplicitly provided through written contracts, or\nCriminal intent to cause nuclear damage is established\nImplication:\nThis shields suppliers from long-term liability linked to latent defects, addressing investor concerns but raising accountability issues.\nGraded Liability Caps\nReplaces the flat ₹1,500 crore liability cap\nIntroduces\ncapacity-based graded liability\n, reflecting differing risk profiles of nuclear installations\nInsurance and Financial Security\nMandatory insurance\napplies only to private operators\nGovernment-owned installations are exempt\nProvision for a\nNuclear Liability Fund\nto meet compensation obligations of the Centre\nEnhanced Penalty Structure\nTwo-tier framework:\nMonetary penalties for minor violations\nImprisonment for serious offences\nMarks a shift toward\ngraduated enforcement\nabsent in earlier laws\nTransparency and RTI Concerns\nSection 39: Overriding RTI Act\nEmpowers the Centre to declare broad categories of nuclear-related information as\n“restricted”\nSuch information becomes\nfully exempt from disclosure\n, overriding the RTI Act, 2005\nWhy This Is Controversial\nRTI Act exemptions are conditional and subject to:\nAppeals\nPublic interest override (Section 8(2))\nSection 39 removes these safeguards entirely\nConcerns Raised:\nInstitutionalised secrecy\nReduced public oversight as private players enter the sector\nWeakened whistleblower protection and independent scrutiny\nFAQs\nQ1. What is the SHANTI Bill, 2025 ?\nIt is a law reforming India’s nuclear energy framework by permitting private participation and replacing older nuclear laws.\nQ2. Does the Bill allow full foreign investment in nuclear power ?\nNo. Foreign participation is conditional and subject to government notification and security norms.\nQ3. How does the Bill change nuclear accident liability ?\nIt removes automatic supplier liability and introduces graded liability caps linked to plant capacity.\nQ4. Who regulates safety under the new law ?\nThe Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) continues as the primary safety regulator.\nQ5. Why is the Bill criticised on transparency grounds ?\nBecause it overrides the RTI Act for nuclear-related information without public interest safeguards.",
